# Description

Setup of a microservice using GraphQL, Apollo Server, Codegen, Prisma, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.

Used Prisma as the source of truth for typing.

Done to understand a little bit more about mutations, schema, some autogeneration via code.

This helped me to understand what really is going on with GraphQL, resolvers and type definitions without any "magic" tool.
